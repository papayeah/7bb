                This American Life closely follows the lives of our neighbours. Episode #550 specifically speaks to the world of polar opposites in education: A class divide between an elite private school, Fieldston, and the poorest congressional district in the nation. The main character? Melanie, a top student from the latter environment; and her journey through the gates of the former.
              </p>

              <p class = "grid__col grid__col--1-of-3">
                The sequence illustrates Melanie’s anxiety and suffocation through the halls of Fieldston into a space with her at the center. The statue, the Mater Dolorosa, is a symbol of perseverance against odds. In this case, the quill of the rejection letter at her feet—inside a cage of her own making.
