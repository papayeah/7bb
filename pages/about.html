        My calculus classmate's cousin, Chris, changed my mind towards pursuing design as a career. Concurrently, my cousin introduced me to Chris Do, who introduced me to design and ArtCenter. I didn't know logos could be critiqued, what a portfolio needed to be, or even what a concept was.<br><br>

        Now I see: The difference between an em-dash and a hyphen, how particular typefaces suit particular words, and the intrinsic throughlines across different expressions into design.<br><br>

        From calculus, to Caslon.
