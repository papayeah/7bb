                The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of Wes Anderson’s most iconic films. (Aren’t they all?)<br><br>

                The sequence follows two stories: Gustave’s point-of-view and Zero’s. As you journey through the funicular, you visit each familiar face’s environment.
              </p>

              <p class = "grid__col grid__col--1-of-3">
                Gustave reveals the superficial nature the bourgeois class. The world of material objects: Perfume, money, and property never satisfy his pride. Opposite to Zero’s, one of vindication and overcoming the odds while being an immigrant. The sequence later reveals how he is happy with few objects of sentimental value. He is resolved in his duties, as he enters the same world—instead with hope and opportunity.
